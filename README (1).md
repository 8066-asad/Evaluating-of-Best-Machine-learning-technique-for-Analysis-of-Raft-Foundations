2. **Explore and preprocess** the data
3. **Engineer relevant features** for foundation analysis
4. **Train and evaluate** all model combinations
5. **Select the best performing** model
6. **Generate comprehensive reports** and visualizations

### 📊 Dataset Requirements

Your Excel file should contain the following columns:
- `Number of Columns`
- `Area Of Raft (m^2)`
- `Column Area (m^2)`
- `Compressive strength of Concrete Fc' (Mpa)`
- `Concrete Unit Weight (kN/m^3)`
- `Subgrade Modulus kN/m/m^2`
- `Maximum Axial Load on Column in kN`
- `Total Axial load on Column (kN)`
- `Thickness of Raft (mm)`
- `Settlement (mm)` (target)
- `Punching Shear Value` (target)
- `Bearing Pressure (kPa)` (target)

### 🔮 Making Predictions

After training, use the saved model for new predictions:

```python
import pickle
import pandas as pd

# Load the trained model
with open('best_model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)

with open('best_scaler.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    scaler = pickle.load(f)

# Make predictions on new data
# See detailed example in the code documentation
```
